name: Generate nodetime binaries

# The reason this is workflow is set up to only run on changes to source code is:
# 1. It is currently 'impossible' to build a deterministic binary (equal hash from equal code)
#    due to the way bytecode generation works in pkg. pkg has a --no-bytecode option, but it won't run because we include bytecode
#    binaries like tsc in our build, and it therefore complains that we are including bytecode in a non-bytecode build.
# 2. It should not be necessary to run it in any other scenarios as the only way the nodetime executable changes
#    is when we make changes to the source code itself (including updating dependencies).
